An all-in-one Android application designed to be the "saviour" for a student's chaotic college life. This app centralizes every scattered piece of campus information into one smart, intuitive, and predictive companion.

## 🚀 The Problem We Solve

College life is confusing. Information is everywhere:
* Timetables are in a PDF.
* Event notices are on a physical board.
* Campus maps are non-existent or hard to read.
* You're constantly asking, "Where is room AX-510?" or "Will I be late for my next class?"

This disorganization leads to stress, being late, and missing out on campus life.

## ✨ The Solution: Your Campus, Simplified

The **Smart Campus Companion** connects everything. It's an intelligent helper that syncs live data from the cloud, works offline, and even predicts problems *before* they happen.

## 🌟 Core Features

* **Smart Dashboard:** The first screen you see. It greets you by name, shows your profile picture, and displays your live schedule for *today*.
* 🧠 **Predictive ML Smart Alert:** The app's "brain." It's not just a simple check.
    1.  It parses your timetable for back-to-back classes.
    2.  It uses a **distance matrix** to calculate the *meters* you have to travel (e.g., "AX411" to "AX508").
    3.  It calculates the *time gap* you have in minutes.
    4.  It runs a **heuristic ML model** to predict your risk of being late, classifying it as `High Risk` (in red) or `Heads Up` (in blue).
* ⚡ **Offline-First Timetable:** Your entire weekly timetable is synced from Firebase and stored locally in a **Room Database**. This means your schedule *always* loads instantly, even with bad campus Wi-Fi.
* ⭐ **Interactive Canteen Menu:**
    * View the full canteen menu, organized by category.
    * Submit a **5-star rating** for any item.
    * All ratings are averaged and saved in **Firestore**, so the whole campus can see what's good.
* 🗺️ **Live Campus Map:**
    * Full Google Maps integration with a custom map overlay.
    * Search bar to find any building, lab, or office.
    * A "My Location" button to find yourself when you're lost.
* 🤖 **On-Device AI Chatbot:**
    * An instant, on-device chatbot for fast answers.
    * It's a deterministic AI, which means it's **100% accurate** for campus-specific info (no "hallucinations").
    * Features deep native integration—it can provide a button to **"View on Map"** that opens the map and pins the location.
* 🗓️ **Campus Events:** A live-updating list of campus events, pulled directly from Firestore so you never miss a notice.
* 🔒 **Secure Firebase Authentication:** Secure login and registration using Firebase Auth, with all user data synced to the cloud.

## 🏃 How to Run This Project

To build and run this project yourself, you need to provide two secret files:

1.  **Firebase Config:**
    * Go to your new Firebase project.
    * Create an Android app with the package name `com.example.smartcampus`.
    * Download the `google-services.json` file.
    * Place this file in the `app/` directory.

2.  **Google Maps API Key:**
    * This project securely loads the API key from a `local.properties` file (which is *not* on GitHub).
    * In the root of the project, create a file named `local.properties`.
    * Go to your Google Cloud Console, get your Maps API Key, and paste it into the file like this:
        ```
        MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE
        ```
    * Build the project. The `build.gradle.kts` file will automatically read this key and inject it into the app.
